# Setting Up a Testing Environment

## Introduction

Now that we've started and you understand what the course is about, our first task is to set up a testing environment. We need to create a project with all the necessary tools for running tests.

In this section, I will:

1. Show you how an example environment could look
2. Walk you through the required tools and elements
3. Demonstrate an example setup

## Course Setup

We'll use multiple setups throughout the course, but we'll have a base setup that we'll use primarily. I'll show you this setup, and you'll receive all these setups from me.

## Alternatives and Tool Choices

I'll discuss various alternatives we have at certain points:

- Different tools we could use for the same job
- Why I'm choosing specific tools for this course

It's important to note that what you'll learn in this course will apply generally, regardless of which setup you later use in your projects.

## Conclusion

By the end of this section, you'll have a solid understanding of how to set up a testing environment and the flexibility to adapt these concepts to different project requirements.
