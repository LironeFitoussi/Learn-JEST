Reminder on Async Await and act Warnings
This a reminder about adding async with an await in front of user.click and user.keyboard events similar to the earlier lecture here.



The affected code in the upcoming lecture for App.test.js should now look like this:



test('can receive a new user and show it on a list', async () => {
 
...
 
  await user.click(nameInput);
  await user.keyboard('jane');
  await user.click(emailInput);
  await user.keyboard('jane@jane.com');
 
  await user.click(button);
 
...


After this, the "Touch of Test Driven Development" lecture will add a test to UserForm.test.js which will also need the same refactor to use async await.

Please refer to the attached zip code for both of these lectures for the completed and updated test code if necessary.
